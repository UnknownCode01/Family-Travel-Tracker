# Family-Travel-Tracker
Here I made a website which keeps track of travelled countries using node js, express and postgres  

<b>Process</b>
1. Using postgres make a database
2. Rename database name and password in index.js line 11 and 12
3. Make sure to use the queries that I shared on postgres
4. Run the code using: node index.js in console
5. Only use the country name mentioned in the index.ejs inside views folder from line 33 onwards
